# 🧠 AI Financial Assistant  
**Personalized Debt Reduction and Financial Advice using LLM and RAG**

---

## 📘 Project Description

This project aims to build an interactive AI-powered assistant that helps users better manage personal finances — especially debt. The assistant answers user questions and provides personalized advice, based on real financial guides, debt management strategies, and practical behavioral principles.

It will use state-of-the-art NLP and LLM tools, and be structured as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with a simple web interface for interaction.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Solve a real-world problem: lack of access to quality financial advice
- Use GenAI capabilities to create a reliable Q&A assistant
- Demonstrate mastery of NLP, LLMs, Prompt Engineering, Vector Search, and basic UI

---

## ✅ Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Load and clean 5–10 financial articles/guides
- Preprocess texts and create vector embeddings
- Build a FAISS or Chroma vector store
- Implement a RAG pipeline (semantic retrieval + GPT answer)
- User interface built with Streamlit (or Gradio)
- Basic logging of questions and answers to CSV

---

## 💡 Optional Features

- Categorization of questions (budget, credit, mistakes)
- Interactive analytics dashboard (frequent topics, question stats)
- Visualizations (WordCloud, bar charts)
- User-selectable answer tone (friendly, strict, neutral)
- PDF summary generator
- User feedback: was the answer helpful?

## 🧪 Ethical Considerations

This project will include a reflection on:
- Explainability of responses
- Risks of incorrect financial suggestions
- Bias in the source data
- Appropriate disclaimers (e.g. "not legal financial advice")
