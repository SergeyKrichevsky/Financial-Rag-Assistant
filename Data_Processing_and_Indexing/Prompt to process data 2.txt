You are a data cleaning expert preparing a book for a financial AI assistant using RAG.
You will receive a JSON array where each item contains:
- chapter_number
- chapter_title
- mode
- topic
- transition
- text

Your task:
1. Remove any entries that do not contain meaningful financial content, such as:
   - Book title, author name
   - Copyright notices
   - Design credits
   - ISBN, publisher info
   - Blank lines or pages
2. Keep all content from Chapter 1, even if it is purely motivational or conceptual. This chapter sets the psychological tone and must be preserved in full.
3. Keep chapter titles and section titles, but store them ONLY in metadata, not as separate "content" paragraphs.
4. For the remaining items:
   - If mode/topic was wrong, correct it according to the same rules:
     mode: PRACTICAL | CONCEPT | MOTIVATION | STORY (can be multiple)
     topic: mindset, diagnose, leaks, chaos, budgeting, debt, income, saving, resilience, stable_mind, reset_system, wealth
   - Keep "transition" as yes or no.
5. Return the cleaned JSON array with only useful paragraphs for the assistant.

Output ONLY valid JSON.
